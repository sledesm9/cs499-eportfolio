  <h1>Algorithms & Data Structures – Course Planner (C++)</h1>
  <p>This page includes my narrative reflection and access to the original and enhanced versions of the Course Planner project.</p>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Course Planner application was originally designed to read course data from a CSV file
      and allow users to search for courses and view prerequisites.
      The original version relied on basic parsing and standard data handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the enhancement, I improved parsing reliability, added stronger input validation,
      and implemented a <strong>map data structure</strong> to automatically maintain alphabetical
      order of courses. These changes improved search efficiency, readability, and overall maintainability.

    <h2>Narrative Reflection</h2>

    <h3>Brief Description</h3>
    <p>
      This artifact was originally developed in CS 260 as a demonstration of data structures
      and algorithm implementation in C++. The goal was to build a system that could store,
      organize, and retrieve course information efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Justification for Inclusion</h3>
    <p>
      I selected this artifact because it highlights my understanding of algorithmic thinking
      and data structure selection. The enhancement process allowed me to move from a
      functional but basic implementation to a more structured and efficient design.
      By implementing a map data structure, I demonstrated knowledge of associative containers
      and improved time complexity for searching and organizing records.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
    <p>
      While enhancing this project, I learned the importance of selecting the correct
      data structure based on the problem requirements.
      My original approach worked, but it did not optimize search efficiency or ensure
      consistent ordering of results. Refactoring the code required careful restructuring
      to preserve functionality while improving algorithmic performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One challenge was ensuring accurate CSV parsing and handling invalid input gracefully.
      This experience strengthened my understanding of defensive programming and
      efficient algorithm design. The enhancement supports course outcomes related to
      computing solution evaluation, algorithmic trade-offs, and professional code organization.
