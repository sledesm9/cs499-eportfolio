  <h1>Algorithms & Data Structures – Course Planner (C++)</h1>

  <div class="card">

    <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
    <p>
      To fulfill this milestone, I selected a C++ course planner that reads course data from a CSV file
      and stores the data with structured data types. The program allows users to load course data,
      print a list of all courses in alphabetical order, and search for a course to find its title and prerequisites.
      This project was originally designed as part of a data structures and file processing assignment early in my
      Computer Science course of study. However, I have enhanced this project to better demonstrate algorithms,
      data structures, and input validation.
    </p>

    <h2>Justification for Inclusion and Enhancements</h2>
    <p>
      I selected this project because I believe it clearly represents my ability to utilize basic data structures
      and algorithms. This course planner uses a map to store course data with the course number as the key,
      allowing for quick lookups and maintaining data in alphabetical order automatically. The prerequisites for each
      course are stored in vectors, making the structure flexible and easy to manage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among the enhancements I have added to this project, I have improved how user input is handled, added trimming
      and uppercasing to improve search functionality, improved user feedback for file loading, and cleaned up the
      parsing logic. These enhancements improve the reliability and maintainability of the project while maintaining
      its clear algorithms.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Design and evaluate computing solutions:</strong> This enhancement demonstrates designing and evaluating
        a computing solution using appropriate data structures and algorithms (map for sorted storage and efficient lookup,
        vectors for prerequisites, and structured parsing).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Computing practices and tools:</strong> Improved validation, clearer parsing logic, and better user feedback
        to make the program more reliable and maintainable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security mindset:</strong> Improved input validation and error handling to better protect against invalid input
        and file-loading issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Professional communication:</strong> Clear structure and readable output so users can understand what the program
        is doing and why.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This enhancement clearly represents the learning outcome of designing and evaluating computing solutions using
      appropriate data structures and algorithms. I have clearly demonstrated this by using structured parsing, maintaining
      data in alphabetical order using a map, and using efficient algorithms to look up course data.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have also improved reliability with validation and error handling, which relates to secure programming practices.
      I have learned that even small structural changes to a project can greatly improve its quality.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most challenging parts of this project was working with file paths and user input, and I have learned a
      great deal from overcoming that challenge that relates to how programs interact with external data sources.
      This enhancement represents a significant improvement in my ability to create and improve algorithms for computing
      solutions that will be suitable for my ePortfolio.
    </p>
