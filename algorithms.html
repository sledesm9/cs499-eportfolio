    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Course Planner application reads course data from a CSV file and allows users
      to search for courses and view prerequisites. The original version worked, but it
      relied on basic parsing and did not emphasize efficiency or stronger validation.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the enhancement, I improved input validation, refined CSV parsing, and used a
      <strong>map data structure</strong> to keep courses automatically sorted alphabetically.
      These changes improved search efficiency, reduced unnecessary processing, and made the
      code easier to maintain.

    <h3>Brief Description</h3>
    <p>
      This artifact was originally created in CS 260 to demonstrate how data structures and
      algorithms can be used to store, organize, and retrieve structured information.
      The Course Planner loads course records and allows the user to search and display them
      along with prerequisite relationships.
    </p>

    <h3>Justification for Inclusion</h3>
    <p>
      I selected this artifact because it clearly demonstrates algorithmic thinking and data
      structure selection. Enhancing this project gave me the opportunity to improve efficiency,
      strengthen reliability, and write cleaner code while still meeting functional requirements.
      Using a map structure helped maintain sorting automatically and improved lookups compared to
      a less structured approach.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection on Enhancement</h3>
    <p>
      While improving this project, I learned how much data structure choice affects overall program
      performance and maintainability. The biggest challenge was refining parsing logic without breaking
      functionality and making sure invalid inputs were handled safely. This enhancement reinforced the
      importance of defensive programming, trade-offs between simplicity and efficiency, and writing
      code that can scale with larger datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
      This artifact supports course outcomes related to algorithmic principles, evaluating computing
      solutions, professional communication, and building more reliable and efficient programs.
