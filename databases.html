  <h1>Databases – SQLite Ticket Tracker (Python)</h1>

  <div class="card">

    <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
    <p>
      For my database enhancement artifact, I created a compact support ticket tracker using Python with a SQLite database.
      I decided to use this artifact because it is a clear example of how I can apply my knowledge of databases in a real-world context.
      The artifact demonstrates multiple database skills, including schema design, safe querying, indexing, and reporting queries.
    </p>

    <h2>Justification for Inclusion and Enhancements</h2>
    <p>
      This program demonstrates several skills with a database. I created a schema with required fields,
      so users cannot insert bad data. I used parameterized queries when inserting data, which makes it safer.
      I added an index to frequently queried fields, which makes it faster. The program does more than just insert and select data.
      It also aggregates and reports data, which is a clear example of how I can organize and retrieve information from a database.
    </p>

    <p>
      The improvements raised the quality and structure of the artifact. I enhanced the database by adding schema constraints
      to ensure integrity, creating indexed columns to support faster searching, and developing reusable functions for database access.
      In addition, I developed reporting queries to generate useful summaries. These changes moved the project beyond a basic CRUD system
      toward something closer to a real-world database component.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      The improvements align with course outcomes focused on using appropriate tools and techniques to create database-driven solutions
      and designing computing solutions with the right technical skills. The primary goal was improving applied database skills, and
      these enhancements helped me accomplish that through a practical exercise.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most important things I learned is that database quality depends heavily on schema design and validation, not just queries.
      The main challenge was improving the database without making the project overly complicated. I overcame this challenge by focusing on
      meaningful improvements and avoiding features that were not useful to the project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, this artifact shows my ability to build and enhance a working database solution using practical techniques.
