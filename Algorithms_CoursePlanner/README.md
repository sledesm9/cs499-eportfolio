Course Planner – Data Structures and Algorithms Enhancement

This is a C++ program designed to be a course planner. This program reads the courses from a CSV file and provides a user interface to load the courses, view all the courses, and search for a specific course. This program was originally developed earlier in the Computer Science program and then enhanced for the current CS 499 ePortfolio milestone project on algorithms and data structures.

The purpose of the program is to show the application of the fundamental data structures and algorithms in a real life situation. This program maintains a collection of courses in a map data structure, which is a collection of key-value pairs. This map is sorted by the key, which is the course number. This makes the search for a specific course efficient. This program also utilizes a struct to organize the data within a class. Prerequisites for a course are maintained as a vector to allow dynamic expansion of the data structure. This program parses the CSV file using string streams and several helper functions to split the string and clean the data before storing it in the appropriate data structure. This shows the appropriate use of data structures to improve the efficiency of the program.

A number of enhancements were implemented to further improve the quality and usability of the original version. These enhancements include improving input handling to ensure that the program does not crash when users enter invalid values in the menu options. String trimming and normalization were implemented to ensure that course search functionality works even when users enter course names in lowercase or include extra spaces in the names. Improvements were implemented in file loading to ensure that users know whether data was loaded or not. The code was cleaned up, and parsing was improved by splitting code into helper functions to enhance readability and maintainability.

To use the artifact, compile the C++ code and use a C++17-compatible compiler such as clang++ or g++. Once compiled, a new window will appear, and users will select the option to load data from a menu. Users will be prompted to enter a path to a file that contains a list of courses in a CSV format. Once data is loaded, users will have an option to print all courses or search for a specific course by its number.

This artifact demonstrates growth in algorithmic thinking, data structure selection, input validation, and modular program design. It reflects a stronger focus on writing readable, maintainable code and making small but meaningful improvements that increase software quality. It is included in the ePortfolio as evidence of practical skills in algorithms and data structures and the ability to enhance an existing solution in a thoughtful and measurable way.
