  <p>
    Welcome to my professional ePortfolio. This portfolio highlights my growth throughout
    the Computer Science program and demonstrates enhancements in software design,
    algorithms and data structures, and database development.

  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <p>
      In this self-assessment, I reflect on my academic journey, technical development,
      collaboration experiences, and how my coursework and artifact enhancements
      have prepared me for a career in software development.

  <h2>Artifacts</h2>

  <!-- Software Design -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Software Design – Animal Shelter (MongoDB)</h3>
    <p>
      This project began as a CRUD module connected to a MongoDB database for managing
      animal rescue records. I enhanced the structure by organizing responsibilities more
      clearly within the class, improving error handling, removing hardcoded credentials,
      and replacing print statements with structured logging.
      These changes improved maintainability, security, and overall professionalism.

  <!-- Algorithms -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Algorithms & Data Structures – Course Planner (C++)</h3>
    <p>
      The Course Planner application reads course information from a CSV file and allows
      users to search for courses and view prerequisites. I enhanced this project by refining
      parsing logic, improving input validation, and implementing a map data structure to
      automatically maintain alphabetical order.
      These updates improved efficiency, readability, and reliability.

  <!-- Databases -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Databases – SQLite Ticket Tracker</h3>
    <p>
      This artifact is a support ticket tracking system built with Python and SQLite.
      I enhanced the database schema by adding constraints, indexed fields, and
      parameterized queries to protect data integrity and improve performance.
      I also implemented reporting queries to generate meaningful summaries.
