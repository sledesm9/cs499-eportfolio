  <h2>CS 499 Computer Science Capstone</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome to my ePortfolio. This portfolio highlights my growth throughout the
    Computer Science program and demonstrates enhancements in software design,
    algorithms and data structures, and database development.

    <!-- Software Design -->
    <div class="card">
      <h4>Software Design – Animal Shelter (MongoDB)</h4>
      <p>
        This project began as a simple CRUD module connected to a MongoDB database
        for managing animal rescue records. I enhanced the structure by organizing
        responsibilities more clearly within the class, improving error handling,
        removing hardcoded credentials, and replacing print statements with Python’s
        logging module. These changes improved maintainability, security, and overall
        professionalism. The module also integrates with a Dash dashboard to allow
        users to visualize and filter data in real time.

    <!-- Algorithms -->
    <div class="card">
      <h4>Algorithms & Data Structures – Course Planner (C++)</h4>
      <p>
        The Course Planner application reads course information from a CSV file
        and allows users to search for courses and view prerequisites. I enhanced
        this project by refining parsing logic, improving input validation, and
        using a map data structure to automatically maintain alphabetical order.
        These updates improved search efficiency and reliability while making
        the code easier to understand and maintain.

    <!-- Databases -->
    <div class="card">
      <h4>Databases – SQLite Ticket Tracker</h4>
      <p>
        This artifact is a support ticket tracking system built with Python and
        SQLite. I enhanced the database schema by adding constraints, indexed
        fields, and parameterized queries to protect data integrity and improve
        performance. I also implemented reporting queries so the system can provide
        meaningful summaries rather than just storing records. These improvements
        reflect practical database design and secure data handling practices.
