    <h4>Software Design – Animal Shelter (MongoDB)</h4>
    <p>
      This project began as a basic CRUD module connected to a MongoDB database.
      I enhanced it by reorganizing the code structure, improving error handling,
      and integrating it with an interactive Dash dashboard. The result is a more
      modular, readable, and user-friendly system that allows animal rescue staff
      to filter and explore data efficiently.

    <h4>Algorithms & Data Structures – Course Planner (C++)</h4>
    <p>
      The Course Planner application was originally designed to load and display
      course data from a CSV file. I enhanced this project by refining the data
      structures and improving search efficiency. These changes reduced unnecessary
      processing and made the program more scalable while maintaining clarity
      in the code design.

    <h4>Databases – SQLite Ticket Tracker</h4>
    <p>
      This database project tracks support tickets and resolution times using SQLite.
      I enhanced the schema by adding constraints, validation checks, and indexed
      queries to improve performance and data integrity. These improvements make
      the system more reliable and better aligned with real-world database practices.
