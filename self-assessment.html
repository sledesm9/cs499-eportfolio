Stevan Ledesma
CS 499 – Computer Science Capstone
In the course of my studies in the Computer Science program of Southern New Hampshire University, I have learned a lot, especially in terms of how to code and how to work with people. When I began, my main goal was to get the code running. Along the way, however, I have come to understand that being a computer science professional entails many things: communication, design, efficiency, teamwork, and security, among others.
One of the things that I have become good at, which I think is important for a computer science professional, is the ability to communicate technical concepts in a way that everyone can understand. In the video for the code review of the capstone project, for example, I have demonstrated the ability to communicate how the code works and how it was designed. This skill, in my view, is important for a computer science professional since it enables a person to contribute to decision-making in a team or in a work setting.
In the course of my studies, especially in the course of Data Structures and Algorithms, I have become proficient in the different aspects of computer science, especially in the areas of data structures and algorithms. In the Course Planner project, for example, I used maps and vectors in C++ to organize the course data in an efficient manner. This project, which strengthened my knowledge of how to work with different aspects of computer science, has taught me a lot about problem-solving.
In my experience in software engineering and database development, I have gained experience in creating software that is structured, maintainable, and secure. In the Animal Shelter project, I have demonstrated my understanding of modular programming and CRUD operations on MongoDB databases, while in the SQLite Ticket Tracker project, I have demonstrated my understanding of database development, database constraints, and parameterized queries.
From my experiences in the program, I have developed a greater understanding of security in software development. I have realized that security is a fundamental aspect of software development that cannot be considered as an afterthought but from the very beginning of development.
The artifacts presented in my portfolio represent my development from my initial stages in the program to my final stages. They demonstrate my capability to develop structured software, efficient algorithms, secure databases, and communicate my ideas effectively. This capstone represents not only the technical skills I have developed, but also my confidence and preparedness to enter the field of computer science.</pre>
