    CS 499 – Computer Science Capstone</p>

    <p>
      Throughout my studies in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, 
      I have grown both technically and professionally. When I first began, my main goal was simply 
      to get my code running. Over time, however, I developed a deeper understanding that being a 
      computer science professional requires much more than writing functional code. It involves 
      communication, structured design, efficiency, teamwork, and a strong security mindset.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most important skills I developed is the ability to communicate technical concepts 
      clearly. In my capstone code review video, I demonstrated how I can explain code structure, 
      identify improvements, and justify design decisions. This ability is essential in professional 
      environments where collaboration and decision-making depend on clarity and shared understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Data Structures and Algorithms, I strengthened my problem-solving skills. In the Course 
      Planner project, I used maps and vectors in C++ to efficiently organize and retrieve course 
      data. This project helped me better understand algorithm efficiency, data organization, and 
      performance trade-offs.
    </p>

    <p>
      In software engineering and database development, I gained experience designing structured 
      and maintainable systems. In the Animal Shelter project, I applied modular programming and 
      CRUD operations using MongoDB. In the SQLite Ticket Tracker project, I enhanced database 
      schema design by adding constraints, indexing, and parameterized queries to improve both 
      performance and data integrity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Security has become a key focus in my development process. I now understand that security 
      must be considered from the beginning of development rather than added later. Whether 
      removing hardcoded credentials, validating input, or implementing parameterized queries, 
      I consistently apply secure coding practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      The artifacts in this portfolio demonstrate my progression from early coursework to more 
      advanced system design and implementation. They reflect my ability to develop structured 
      software, implement efficient algorithms, build secure database systems, and communicate 
      technical decisions effectively. This capstone represents not only my technical growth, 
      but also my readiness to enter the field of computer science with confidence.
