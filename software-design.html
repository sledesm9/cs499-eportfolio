    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This artifact began as a CRUD module connected to a MongoDB database
      for managing animal rescue records. The original implementation focused
      primarily on functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      For my enhancement, I improved code organization, removed hardcoded credentials,
      strengthened error handling, and implemented structured logging instead of
      print statements. These changes improved maintainability, professionalism,
      and security.

    <h3>Brief Description</h3>
    <p>
      This artifact was originally created in CS 340 to demonstrate MongoDB
      integration with Python. The goal was to design a reusable class
      capable of performing CRUD operations on an animal rescue database.
    </p>

    <h3>Justification for Inclusion</h3>
    <p>
      I selected this artifact because it demonstrates software engineering
      principles such as modular design, database connectivity, and backend
      system organization. The enhancement process allowed me to strengthen
      code structure and improve security practices by removing sensitive
      information from the source code and implementing logging.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection on Enhancement</h3>
    <p>
      During enhancement, I realized that functional code is not the same as
      professional code. Refactoring helped me focus on maintainability,
      readability, and secure design decisions. One challenge was ensuring
      that restructuring the code did not break existing database operations.
      This process strengthened my understanding of software design trade-offs
      and secure programming practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      This artifact supports course outcomes related to software engineering,
      professional communication, computing best practices, and security mindset.
