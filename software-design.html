  <h1>Software Design – Animal Shelter (MongoDB)</h1>

  <div class="card">

    <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
    <p>
      The chosen artifact is the AnimalShelter Python CRUD module, which handles database 
      tasks for an animal rescue collection stored in MongoDB. I originally developed this 
      project in CS 340 Module Four. The system allows users to create, retrieve, update, 
      and delete animal records. It also includes search routines for water rescue dogs, 
      mountain or wilderness rescue dogs, and dogs trained for disaster or individual searches.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is organized into a reusable class called <strong>AnimalShelter</strong>. 
      This design allows other projects or dashboards to import and use the module 
      without modification.
    </p>

    <h2>Justification for Inclusion and Enhancements</h2>

    <p>
      This artifact serves as evidence of my software design and engineering abilities. 
      Specific components that demonstrate my skills include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Object-Oriented Design:</strong> The AnimalShelter class encapsulates database operations with clearly defined method responsibilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Database Interaction:</strong> The system connects to MongoDB and retrieves animal records. Users can filter results by animal type, age, and breed.</li>
      <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> The system uses try-except blocks to ensure the program does not crash unexpectedly during execution.</li>
      <li><strong>Dashboard Integration:</strong> The module supports Dash/Jupyter Dash integration, allowing real-time data visualization.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I implemented several key updates to enhance the project:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Replaced all print statements with Python’s logging module to improve traceability.</li>
      <li>Added timestamped log records to assist with system maintenance and debugging.</li>
      <li>Removed hardcoded credentials to strengthen security.</li>
      <li>Added a README file explaining system design, installation, and usage instructions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Software Engineering & Design:</strong> Implemented logging and improved documentation to align the project with professional coding practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Security Mindset:</strong> Removing hardcoded credentials reduces vulnerabilities and protects sensitive information.</li>
      <li><strong>Computing Solutions Design:</strong> Organized the class structure so each method has a clear responsibility, improving readability and maintainability.</li>
      <li><strong>Professional Communication:</strong> The README provides structured documentation explaining module usage and architecture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      One of the most important improvements was enhancing maintainability through clear 
      commenting and documentation. Descriptive comments were added to each method 
      so that future developers — or myself — can easily understand its purpose and usage.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also improved exception handling to clarify expected behavior under different 
      situations and error cases. This strengthened reliability while maintaining simplicity.
    </p>

    <p>
      A key lesson I learned is that small improvements — such as improving documentation 
      and logging — can significantly elevate the professionalism of a project without 
      changing its core functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      One challenge was ensuring comments remained accurate, concise, and meaningful 
      without cluttering the code. Overall, these enhancements made the artifact more 
      polished, maintainable, and reflective of my growth as a software developer.
    </p>
