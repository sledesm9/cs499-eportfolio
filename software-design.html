  <h1>Software Design – Animal Shelter (MongoDB)</h1>
  <p>This page presents my narrative reflection along with direct access to the original and enhanced source code.</p>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This artifact began as a CRUD module connected to a MongoDB database for managing animal rescue records.
      The original implementation focused primarily on functionality. For my enhancement, I improved the
      organization of the class structure, removed hardcoded credentials, strengthened error handling,
      and implemented structured logging instead of print statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      These improvements increased maintainability, professionalism, and security while preparing the system
      for real-world scalability. The module also integrates with a Dash dashboard to allow interactive
      filtering and visualization of rescue data.

    <h2>Narrative Reflection</h2>

    <h3>Brief Description</h3>
    <p>
      This artifact was originally developed in CS 340 as part of a MongoDB integration project.
      It was designed to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on an animal rescue database.
      The goal was to connect Python to MongoDB and allow structured data interaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Justification for Inclusion</h3>
    <p>
      I selected this artifact because it demonstrates core software engineering principles such as modular
      design, database integration, and backend development. The enhancement process allowed me to apply
      stronger structural organization and implement better security practices.
      By improving error handling and removing hardcoded credentials, I demonstrated growth in writing
      production-level code rather than classroom-only solutions.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
    <p>
      During enhancement, I realized that while my original implementation worked functionally,
      it lacked professional structure and security awareness. Refactoring the code forced me to think
      critically about separation of responsibilities, logging practices, and secure credential management.
      One challenge I faced was restructuring without breaking database connectivity.
      This experience strengthened my understanding of maintainability and secure software architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      This enhancement supports multiple course outcomes including professional communication,
      computing best practices, secure coding principles, and the ability to evaluate and improve
      an existing computing solution.
